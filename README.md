# The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to the Basic C-Sharp Projects as part of The Tech Academy curriculum. This repository is designed to showcase my journey through the course, highlighting the progress and evolution of my programming skills in C#. Here, you'll find a collection of coding projects that I've worked on, each illustrating different concepts and challenges encountered along the way.

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive view of the projects I've undertaken as part of The Tech Academy's C# programming course. It will serve as both a personal portfolio and a resource for fellow students or anyone interested in learning about C# through practical examples.

## Projects

As I progress through the course, I will be adding projects that cover a wide range of topics within the C# programming language. This will include, but not be limited to:

- Basics of C# programming
- Data types and variables
- Control flow (conditional statements and loops)
- Methods and functions
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Exception handling
- Working with files and directories
- Accessing databases

Each project will come with a brief description of its purpose, the key concepts it demonstrates, and any challenges I faced and how I overcame them.
